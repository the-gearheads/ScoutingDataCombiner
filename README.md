# ScoutingDataCombiner
Used to combine csv files; intended for use with ghScouting.

## Usage
So you've collected scouting data using ghScouting. However, such data was collected on multiple devices, generating multiple csv files. The simple purpose of this project is to combine those csv files into one large csv file (as suggested by the name). 

- Add all csv files to folder conveniently named `PUT_SCOUTING_DATA_HERE`
	- Make sure to delete dummy1 and dummy2
- Run `py combiner.py`
- A `combinedResults.csv` file should appear!

*Very complicated code-DO NOT OPEN COMBINER.PY*
